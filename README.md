### Documentation of Imagemap osu-web format from [osu!wiki](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/blob/975aff50f053377e7582244f7276337fd13e56d0/wiki/BBCode/en.md) (line 252)

```
[imagemap]
IMAGE_URL
X Y WIDTH HEIGHT REDIRECT TITLE
[/imagemap]
```

The `[imagemap]` tag is used to integrate one or more hyperlinks into an image in rectangular areas.

The image, which is embedded on the website, is represented by the `IMAGE_URL` argument. It needs to directly refer to an image hosted on a website.

To add a clickable area, a new line containing the x and y position of the area, the width and the height of the area as well as a link to redirect to needs to be inserted after the `IMAGE_URL` argument. Additionally, an optional `TITLE` argument will be shown on hovering the area if it is specified. A link may be specified with the `REDIRECT` argument, or omitted with a `#`. Every size unit (`X`, `Y`, `WIDTH`, and `HEIGHT`) is a percentage (0â€“100) without a percent sign.

#

right now there's some flaws like:
+ you can't edit rectangles
+ you can't see rectangles you made
+ redirect link and title should be writed manually outside of the app

im not really planning to support it but maybe some time i will fix these
